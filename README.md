# 💬 Revolutionizing Customer Support with an Intelligent Chatbot for Automated Assistance

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and implementing an **AI-powered chatbot** to automate customer service across sectors. The chatbot utilizes **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to understand user queries, classify intent, and generate helpful responses in real-time. It aims to reduce operational costs, improve service availability, and provide round-the-clock support.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Automate customer service queries using a web-based chatbot.
- Understand and classify user intent using NLP.
- Provide relevant and precise responses with minimal human intervention.
- Enhance customer satisfaction and enable 24/7 support.

---

## 📌 Scope

- Chatbot will handle:
  - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
  - Basic query resolution
  - Redirection to relevant resources
- Language Support: English only
- Platform: Deployed as a web application via **Streamlit** or **Flask**
- Out of Scope (for now): Voice input, multi-language support, WhatsApp/Messenger integration
